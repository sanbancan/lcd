      <P>While waiting for the hardware design to be completed on a project 
      using a standard 4x20 LCD, I decided to get a jump start on the software 
      by prototyping the LCD portion of the project on a PC, connecting the LCD 
      to the printer port. It worked out so well that I decided to share what 
      I'd done.
      <P>The circuit is pretty simple. The data lines on the LCD match up well 
      with the data lines of the parallel port, and extra parallel port I/O 
      lines can be used to simulate the RS, R/W, and E signals on the LCD. The 
      LCD module is pretty low-lower (with the exception of the backlight), so I 
      found that it can be powered from <I>most</I> parallel ports. It worked 
      fine with all the desktop PC's I tried it with, but a laptop I tried (a 
      Toshiba something-or-other) just didn't have enough oomph to power the LCD 
      ...
      <P>Anyway, here's the circuit:
      <P>

        </TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></CENTER>
      <P>The 10K pot controls the contrast of the LCD, though, in practice, I've 
      found that it usually ends up at the ground rail, so you might be able to 
      get by without the pot, and just tie VLC to ground. The diode from pin 17 
      of the printer port to pin 2 of the LCD simply blocks voltage from flowing 
      back into the printer port (in case you hook up an external power supply). 
      If you use an external supply, it's intended to connect to the place on 
      the schematic labeled "+5V". This external supply can also be used to 
      power the LCD's LED backlight (through a current-limiting resistor -- 100 
      ohms is probably too high, but it <I>will</I> turn the backlight on at 
      least dimly).
      <P>I built this circuit up on a little Radio Shack protoboard, using a 
      DB25 for the printer port connector, and a 16-pin terminal strip for the 
      LCD connector, with the interconnects on the back. Not pretty, but it 
      works fine ... 
      <P>
      <HR>

      <P><B>Code</B> 
      <UL>I wrote the code in C, and compiled it with Borland C/C++ v3.1, 
        though you could use QuickBASIC or anything else that gives you access 
        to the parallel port. (Visual Basic for Windows doesn't give you 
        low-level access to the printer port, so you'd have to use a DLL such as 
        IOVBX or VBASM if you want to use VB.)
        <P>Here's the code (<A 
        href="http://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/1495/lcd_4x20.zip">LCD_4X20.ZIP</A>), 
        which includes low-level control, higher-level routines, and a 
        demonstration program, which is also included in executable form, so you 
        can just plug in your LCD and test it right away.
        <P>LCD_4X20.C contains the routines to control the LCD. Most of them are 
        fairly generic, except for the ones at the end of the file, which are 
        the low-level routines that handle the parallel port interface. If you 
        want to use this code on a microcontroller such as the HC11, this one 
        small section is all you'd need to change.
        <P>LCD_4X20.H is the header file for LCD_4X20.C, and contains all the 
        function prototypes for the public routines. Just #include this header 
        file in whatever program you're writing.
        <P>LCD.C is a simple little program that demonstrates how to use the 
        routines in LCD_4X20.C. It displays a menu on the PC screen, and 
        controls the LCD to demonstrate:
        <P>
        <UL>
          <LI>Initializing the LCD. 
          <LI>Clearing the LCD. 
          <LI>Positioning the cursor. 
          <LI>Displaying a string. 
          <LI>Displaying a screen. 
          <LI>"Wiping" a screen clear, then "wiping" another on in its place. 
          <LI>Displaying multiple pages of text. 
          <LI>Using special user-defined characters. 
          <LI>Implementing a menu. 
          <LI>Flashing text. 
          <LI>Creating a "marquee" -- a line of text that scrolls across the 
          screen. 
          <LI>Displaying a bar graph. 
          <LI>Centering text on a line. </LI></UL>
        <P>This code really does quite a lot. If you've never used an LCD module 
        before, I think you'll be surprised at some of the effects that can be 
        achieved. </P></UL>
