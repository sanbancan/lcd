IIT Bombay encourages the use of Internet for all
<strong> ACADEMIC </strong>
purposes. 
<p>
Please note that due to oversight/error/misconfiguration  
even <strong> useful </strong> sites
may some times get blocked.
If this is hurting your academic work badly,
please send (polite :-) email to
<a href=mailto:help@cc.iitb.ac.in> help@cc.iitb.ac.in </a>
who will fix this as soon as possible.
<br>
NOTE:
Local sites (*.iitb.ac.in) are also not fetched by proxy.
Please configure your browser No Proxy setting suitably so that
you read *.iitb.ernet.in pages directly without additional load
on the proxy server. Ask your sysadm for help if you are not
able to do this easily.
<p>
The newsgroup  iitb.general is the right forum for public
debate.  Please post there any
constructive views/criticisms/suggestions you have
based on which policies in place will be reviewed regularly.
